# Blacklist Pages
A simple Chrome extension to block certain pages when you load them. Intended for you to improve your internet usage.
## To download:
Click "Code" at the top of the list of files, then click "Download ZIP".

From there, unpack the ZIP's contents. Navigate to <a href="chrome://extensions">chrome://extensions</a>, turn "developer mode" (top right) on.

Then click "Load unpacked", and select the contents of the ZIP you unpacked.

## But why?
This is my first Chrome extension I've ever developed, so it's not the best. Just a way for me to practice and learn the concepts.
